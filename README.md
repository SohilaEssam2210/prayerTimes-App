# Prayer Times Web App

This web application provides prayer times for various cities in Egypt and displays a smooth background image carousel. Users can also see a countdown to the next prayer. The data is fetched using the [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api) and updates dynamically based on the city selected by the user.

## Features

- **Prayer Times Display**: The app fetches prayer times for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha for the selected city.
- **City Selection**: Users can choose from a predefined list of cities (Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, Asyut, Daqahliyah), and the app will update the prayer times accordingly.
- **Dynamic Countdown**: A countdown timer shows the time remaining for the next prayer. Once the prayer time is reached, it shows "It's time for prayer!".
- **Background Image Carousel**: Smoothly transitioning background images change every 15 seconds with a smooth fade in and out effect.
- **Real-Time Clock**: Displays the current time of the selected city.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For creating the structure, styling, and functionality of the application.
- **Aladhan API**: Used to fetch real-time prayer times for different cities in Egypt.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used to handle API requests.
- **JavaScript Date Object**: For handling and calculating times and countdowns.
